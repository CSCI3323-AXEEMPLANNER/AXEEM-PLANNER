### Overview

Our group is proposing a multi-functional application dedicated to SFASU's students, faculty, 
and AARC. It will facilitate communication and organization services that are 
specific to user types. These services will include organized class scheduling, to-do 
task management, course notifications (due dates, assignments, events), live chatting 
with AARC staff, and eventually, a social network.

### Goals

Our goals are to confine the many separate systems and services for students into a multi-functional, single-use application.
